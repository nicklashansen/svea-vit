## Setup
We assume that you have access to a GPU with CUDA >=9.2 support. All dependencies can then be installed with the following commands:

```
conda env create -f setup/conda.yaml
conda activate svea
sh setup/install_envs.sh
```


## Training & Evaluation

The `scripts` directory contains bash scripts for both SVEA and a DrQ baseline, which can be run by `sh scripts/svea.sh` and `sh scripts/drq.sh`, respectively.

Alternatively, you can call the python scripts directly, e.g. for training call

```
python3 src/train.py
```

to run SVEA on the default task, `walker_walk`, and using default hyperparameters. This should give you an output of the form:

```
Working directory: logs/walker_walk/svea/default/1
Evaluating: logs/walker_walk/svea/default/1
| eval | S: 0 | ER: 26.2285 | ERTEST: 25.3730
| train | E: 1 | S: 250 | D: 328.1 s | R: 0.0000 | ALOSS: 0.0000 | CLOSS: 0.0000 | AUXLOSS: 0.0000
```
where `ER` and `ERTEST` corresponds to the average return in the training and test environments, respectively. You can select the test environment used in evaluation with the `--eval_mode` argument, which accepts one of `(original, color_easy, color_hard, video_easy, video_hard)`. Note that training time is approximately 9 days for 500k frames.
